# Infinite Video Creator

This Python script uses the [MoviePY](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/) library to create a zooming video from a set of images. The main purpose of this script is to concatenate a series of images generated by the zoom-out feature of Midjourney into a coherent and smooth video clip.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3
* moviepy library

### Installation

Clone the project to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://codeberg.org/betazetadev/infinite-video-creator
```

### Usage

The images to be used by the script should be placed in a folder named imgs located in the same directory as the script. Each image should be a .png file and should have a number indicating its position in its filename (e.g., 1.png, 2.png, etc.). The images are ordered based on these numbers, with the higher numbers (corresponding to the closest image in terms of zoom) processed first, and the lower numbers (corresponding to the farthest image) processed last.

You can run the project using Python. The script accepts several parameters:

* `smooth`: Enable smooth transitions between image clips.
* `resolution`: Specify the resolution of the output video (square). Default is 1024.
* `fps`: Set frames per second in the output video. Default is 24.
* `output`: Set the name for the output video file. The `.mp4` extension will be added automatically.

```bash
python creator.py
```

## Issues

* Blurry corners during transitions: There's a known issue where the corners of the image clips become blurry during transitions, especially at the points where the current and the next images merge because of some difference between the generated images by Midjourney.
