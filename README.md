# Infinite Video Creator

This Python script uses the [MoviePY](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/) library to create a zooming video from a set of images. The main purpose of this script is to concatenate a series of images generated by the zoom-out feature of Midjourney into a coherent and smooth video clip.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3
* moviepy library

### Installation

Clone the project to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://codeberg.org/betazetadev/infinite-video-creator
```

### Usage

You can run the project using Python.

```bash
python main.py --output my_output_video_name
```

## Issues

* Blurry corners during transitions: There's a known issue where the corners of the image clips become blurry during transitions, especially at the points where the current and the next images merge because of some difference between the generated images by Midjourney.
